# Obstacle Game
## Project Overview
The goal of this game was to make a challenging, yet simple game which requires the player to dodge the falling objects. The player has a free range of motion throughout the entire screen. The falling objects increase in amount and size as the game progresses. This happens at an exponential rate to make the game more fun and difficult. The scoring system (in hexidecimal) is displayed on the LCD screen, counting up after every successive enemy is avoided.

Additionally, a VGA to HDMI adapter was used to display the game on a modern screen. This is not a requirement for use with a display that supports VGA connection.
